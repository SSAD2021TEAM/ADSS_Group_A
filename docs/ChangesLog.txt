 ______________
| - => Removal |

| # => Change  |
|--------------|

	PresentationLayer:
		+ Printer class: which is responsible for all printing cases & data to the user.
		+ Handlers package: which contains all menu sub-handlers for better performance and cohesion.
		- ActionsMenu class: We just recognized that there is no need for this class because Printer would take place.
		+ Menu fields: because this class is the mapper between other classes in PL.

	DTOsPackage: In order to make connection between BL and PL, we had to make the data objects foreach one,
				   so PL has no access to the real object! Each DTO represents the real object data.
				   + DocumentDTO
				   + DriverDTO
				   + TruckDTO
				   + ShipmentDTO
				   + LocationDTO

	BusinessLayer:
		# Facade fields: the 4 controllers were added to be the fields of this mapper class.
		# Facade class: adding a relation(connection) between Facade and DTOs - the connection from side 2.
		+ Response class: which is used for return values of type message error to the PL in case of error.
		+ ResponseT class: which is responsible of returning Object values to the PL in case of success.
		- Relations of object classes were removed and adjusted for better performance.
